# Prime Context for the AI Coding Assistant (catch it up to speed on the project when starting a new conversation)

Start with reading the AGENTS.md file in (root) to get an understanding of the project.
Read the README.md file to get an understanding of the project.
Read key files in the directories:

how to use code-index

I added new components, please refresh the project index
Uses: refresh_index to update the searchable cache

### Knowledge Base
If our knowledge base dont have all the info or libraries you need you  can use Deepwiki and or octocode
